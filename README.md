# sinatra-portfolio-project

Technical Support Network is a CMS that stores data related to tickets. Clients (customers) and consultants (technicians) are able to request that a consultant completes work. The app has limited functionality for customers, as they should only be able to edit and see what tickets they create. Consultants, on the other hand, are able to create and edit and delete tickets or any type of user at will if they have the admin permission.
